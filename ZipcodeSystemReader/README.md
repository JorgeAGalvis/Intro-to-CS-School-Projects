## Problem 2 - 23 points
Programming Project P8.7 in *Big Java*.

(Note that a snapshot of this problem has been included in the files p8.7.png)

This we I have provided a single template only, `ZipTest.java`. Your code *must* work with the ZipTest class I have provided. This means that you will need to create your own Zipcode class with the interface *implied* by ZipTest.java
