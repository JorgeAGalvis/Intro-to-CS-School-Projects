## F2C

Write a program called F2C that allows the user to convert from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.  The program should prompt for a temperature in Fahrenheit and output a temperature in Celsius.  All calculations should be done in in ints, so be careful of truncation.

*Note: remember the Scanner class from lecture.  Look it up in the Java api and pay special attention to the nextInt method.*

Edit the file *F2C.java* included in the workspace.
