# Counting n-grams 

The main purpose of this project is to build a program that can analyze and provide insights into the distribution of n-grams in a given text. N-grams are fundamental building blocks for understanding and modeling language, and this project helps in extracting information about the most common n-grams and those that occur only once. These insights can be useful in various NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.
